# Warehouse Product Geo-tagging 
  
  ***Background***
  
   The Morning Star Company accounts for over 25% of the California processing tomato production, supplying 40% of the U.S. ingredient tomato paste and diced tomato markets,     with industrial sales of approximately $350 million. Morning Star is a vertically integrated company with business units supplying and servicing all aspect of the tomato industry from seeding and growing in the green house to processing and canning at our factories.
   
   
   ***Problem(s)***
   
   Morning Star stores its product in two types of containers, 300-gallon bins or pallets of 55-gallon drums. These are often stacked 4-5 high and in rows 14 to 30 deep (56’-120’) with a few inches between rows with about 20’ wide aisles in an outside warehouse. If not properly documented when placed in the warehouse, the product could potentially become lost. 
  
  
  ***Objectives***
  
  Using a camera, read the barcode or label on the side of the container and create a geotag of the product for future locating and organization. Ideally the solution would store the data on a local database and could be deployed in such a way that the forklift operators would be able to log the positions quickly and, in the future, autonomously.
